*The Tomates Podres website shows a list of displayed movies and allows a user to see additional movie information and watch a trailer form the movie selected:* 

- Movies : when I visit the app, all movies should be displayed.
- Selected Movie: As a user, I can click a movie, and see that movie’s details. When a movie’s details are displayed, none of the other movies will be visible.
- When a movie’s details are displayed, the user should have a way to return to the main view of all movies.
