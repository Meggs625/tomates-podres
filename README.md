- Movies : when I visit the app, all movies should be displayed.
- Selected Movie: As a user, I can click a movie, and see that movie’s details.When a movie’s details are displayed, none of the other movies will be visible.
- When a movie’s details are displayed, the user should have a way to return to the main view of all movies.
